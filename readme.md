# Volumetric Weight Calculator

This app takes three measurements; Length, Width and Height, and then calculates the volumetric weight.
It then also gives you a chargeable price based upon either the volumetric or actual weight that was returned (whichever one is largest) for the current calculation mode, which you can change by clicking on the logo in the top-right of the screen.

## Other features:

- Dark Mode! - you can toggle dark mode with the light-bulb button in the navbar, or by pressing F4.
- That's it... it calculates volumetric weight and gives you a price.
